# 📘 Mean, Median & Mode Calculator (Python – Terminal Based)

This is a simple **terminal-based Python program** that calculates the **Mean, Median, and Mode** for both **Ungrouped** and **Grouped** data **without using any external modules**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Works directly in the terminal
* Supports **Ungrouped Data**

  * Mean
  * Median
  * Mode
* Supports **Grouped Data**

  * Mean (using class midpoints)
  * Median (using median class formula)
  * Mode (using modal class formula)
* No Python libraries are imported
* Simple and beginner-friendly code structure


## 📌 Program Capabilities

### **Ungrouped Data**

* Accepts a list of numbers
* Calculates:

  * Mean = sum of values ÷ total number
  * Median = middle value(s) when sorted
  * Mode = value occurring most frequently

### **Grouped Data**

* Accepts class intervals and frequencies
* Calculates:

  * Mean using midpoints
  * Median using cumulative frequency
  * Mode using the modal class formula
